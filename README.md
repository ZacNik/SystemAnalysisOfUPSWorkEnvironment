# System Analysis of UPS Employee Satisfaction Information Gathering Methods

Challenge: UPS aims to improve its employee satisfaction feedback process to foster a more engaged and satisfied workforce.

Context: UPS currently employs various methods, including paper-based surveys and focus groups, to gather employee satisfaction feedback. However, these methods face challenges such as low response rates and limited real-time feedback capabilities.

Actions: Through a comprehensive review and analysis, we evaluated the effectiveness, limitations, and opportunities for improvement in UPS's existing feedback mechanisms. This involved assessing accessibility, participation levels, data accuracy, and feedback analysis processes. Additionally, we proposed a modern survey application to address identified challenges and enhance the feedback collection process.

Results: The analysis revealed key challenges, including low participation rates and limited anonymity, while also identifying opportunities for improvement, such as leveraging technology for real-time feedback and data analysis. The proposed solution offers a modern, mobile-friendly platform to streamline feedback collection and foster a culture of continuous improvement.

Recommendations: Based on our findings, we recommend implementing our proposed solution to enhance UPS's employee satisfaction feedback process. This includes prioritizing features that improve anonymity, increase participation rates, and facilitate efficient data analysis. By adopting this solution, UPS can strengthen employee engagement and drive organizational success.
